# ADVANCED Lerping in Unity

Lerping is one of the foundational things you need to know about in video game development! There are so many use cases for lerping it's impossible to name them all! Almost any time you want to rotate, move, or change a value over time, lerping is an option.

In this tutorial repository you'll learn how you can easily apply smoothing and randomness to smoothing by using Animation Curves or MinMaxCurves to achieve nonlinear interpolation on "lerp"s.

As always, all code from [this video](https://youtu.be/3jgFFu3qx7Y) is available on GitHub: https://github.com/llamacademy/advanced-lerping
